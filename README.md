# GitHub4Dummies ðŸ¤–
Here you will have a basic program to code with a friend to try and learn github merging.

Follow the instructions and start to practice you silly goose.


## **STEP 1**

GroupUp! Make groups of 2 or 3 to start this activity. ðŸ¥‚
And create a repo on GitHub together!

## **STEP 2**

Create a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" and push that to the main branch.

## **STEP 3**

Now the fun begins!
You will now both be referenced (You and you're teammate) as P1 and P2 respectively.

Once P1 has finished creating the basic program and pushed it, P2 will now clone the repo and you will both create you're first âœ¨Git Branchâœ¨

To do so you will both need to use the "git checkout -b" that will create a branch, rename it whatever you want (Something with class, we can see the names you give them).

Now you both should be on a different branch P1 on his and P2 on his.

## **STEP 4**

P2 will now do an âœ¨Automatic Mergeâœ¨, in his branch P2 will create a function that prints "GitHub!" under "Hello, Wolrd!".
Once the function works, P2 will add/commit/push, then return to the main branch.

Once on the main branch P2 will merge his branch to the main. With "git merge <BranchName>"
