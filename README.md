# GitHub4Dummies ðŸ¤–
Here you will have a basic program to code with a friend to try and learn github merging.

Follow the instructions and start to practice you silly goose.


## **STEP 1**

GroupUp! Make groups of 2 or 3 to start this activity. ðŸ¥‚
And create a repo on GitHub together!

## **STEP 2**

Create a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" and push that to the main branch.

## **STEP 3**

Now the fun begins!
You will now both be referenced (You and you're teammate) as P1 and P2 respectively.

Once P1 has finished creating the basic program and pushed it, P2 will now clone the repo and you will both create you're first âœ¨Git Branchâœ¨

To do so you will both need to use the "git checkout -b" that will create a branch, rename it whatever you want (Something with class, we can see the names you give them).

Now you both should be on a different branch P1 on his and P2 on his.

Now you must both tell github "Hey i just created a branch", with the following command "git push --set-upstream ... ..."

## **STEP 4**

P2 will now do an âœ¨Automatic Mergeâœ¨, in his branch P2 will create a function that prints "GitHub!" under "Hello, Wolrd!".
Once the function works, P2 will add/commit/push, then return to the main branch.

Once on the main branch P2 will merge his branch to the main. But this time not with the merge command. You are going to checkout you're online repo on github.
Something strange has appeared? Compare and Pull, try it out!

If done correctly this is a automatic merge, and should be done with no modification to the code.

You should now both pull from main to update you're local repos.

## **STEP 5**

Great, now try and have fun and do merges together, maybe eventually you will create a âœ¨conflicting mergeâœ¨. I you do, you are on your own, try and understand an complete the merge

# **THATS ALL FOLKS**

The purpose of this activity is to use the merging tool on git. **But** what about the stumper? Firstly **Dont use git on during you're stumpers unless you have mastered the tool** but if you have then how can you merge without using the site? Well that would be with the "Git merge Branchname" command. This will enable you to merge without accessing the git website. Now that the exercise has been finished you are free to either experiment with git functions, or train on this website [https://learngitbranching.js.org].
